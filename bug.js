This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with PurgeCSS or similar tools that remove unused CSS.  If you have a class that's conditionally rendered, and that condition isn't met during the static analysis, PurgeCSS might remove the class definition, leading to a runtime error.  For example:

```javascript
<template>
  <div v-if="showElement" class="bg-red-500"></div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
data() {
  return {
    showElement: false
  };
}
};
</script>
```

If `showElement` is always `false` during the build, PurgeCSS might remove `bg-red-500`.
